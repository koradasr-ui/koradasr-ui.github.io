# Assignment 01 – Good / Bad Navigation Bar

The goal of the assignment was to create a navigation bar using HTML and CSS, and to demonstrate both good and bad navigation design.

The HTML file uses JavaScript to randomly load either a good CSS file or a bad CSS file when the page is refreshed.

## Process

I began by downloading the starter files from the course GitHub repository and creating the required folder structure on my local computer. I set up an index.html file and included a semantic <nav> element containing an unordered list with four list items. Each list item contains an anchor (<a>) tag, and one of the links includes a class to indicate the current page.

Next, I reviewed the JavaScript provided in the HTML file to understand how it dynamically loads either the good.css or bad.css file at random when the page loads. Once the file paths were corrected, I tested the page in the browser to confirm that the styles were switching correctly on refresh.

I then modified the good.css file to create a clean and usable navigation bar. This included using flexbox to control the layout, styling the links for readability, adding hover effects for better user feedback, and using a media query to display the navigation vertically on smaller screens and horizontally on screens wider than 768px.

After completing the good navigation design, I edited the bad.css file to intentionally create a poor user experience. I experimented with confusing colors, awkward spacing, and disruptive transitions to make the navigation difficult and unpleasant to use, while still maintaining valid CSS and meeting the assignment requirements.

Throughout the process, I frequently tested my work in the browser and made adjustments based on how the navigation looked and behaved at different screen sizes.

## Resources

I referenced the class starter files and used help from online documentation and online videos to better understand how the JavaScript and CSS worked together.

## Collaboration

This project was completed individually.
